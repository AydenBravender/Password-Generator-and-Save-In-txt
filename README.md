# Password-Generator-and-Save-In-txt
This program creates a random password with upper and lowercase letters, numbers and a special character of the length the user wants. It also stores the password in a file so that the user can come back to see what their password was. This code is great if you want to create a password, but you can't think of anything! It also has a unique advantage over other password generators because of its ability to save the password in a .txt document.
